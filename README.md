# NEUR0019_Project
This is a summary of the important commands I used for the NEUR0019 Project

Title: "Analysing the Behaviour of Cortical Interneurons in Wake Vs Sleep using Linear Mixed Effect Models"

The first section 'Data Processing' includes the commands necessary to load the files downloaded from: https://crcns.org/data-sets/fcx/fcx-1/about-fcx-1
& to create the dataframes used for the rest of the analysis 

The second section 'Exploratory Analysis' includes:
- the removal of neurons due to the low spiking activity and the ones missing in REM from NREM, sleep and wake datasets
- the code for all the plots presented in the 'Exploratory Analysis' section in the 'Results' in the report

The third section presents the results from the Linear Mixed Effects models of Wake Vs Sleep, REM, NREM
